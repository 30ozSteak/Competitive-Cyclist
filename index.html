    <h1>Welcome to the Tire Guide</h1>
    <p>Precious few components can make as immediately noticeable a difference as a great set of tires. However, the
      past few years have seen an explosion in new options for mountain bikes, which makes it daunting grying to find
      the right pair of tires for your needs, your terrain, and your preferences. In the Tire Guide, we'll break down
      the key factors you'll need to consider when deciding on your next setup, and we'll follow up with a handful of
      our favorites for every rider. Read on the get up to speed with this rapidly evolving, yet widley misunderstood

    <h1>Selecting Your Application</h1>
    <p class="step-description">You're already no doubt aware that tires can be found in a staggering array of options
      for a wide range of uses.
      At this point, it's almost a foregone conclusion that most riders have opted for a tubeless setups, which
      typically offer greater puncture resistance, reduced rolling resistance, and an improved feel for the trail.
      Accordingly, tubes have been largely relegated to a trailside repair option.</p>

    <h1>Tread and Rubber Compound</h1>
    <p class="step-description">Generally speaking, riders will refer to a given tire by its tread pattern, but tread
      pattern is only one part
      of the equation. Don't make the mistake of thinking that a given tread pattern will offer the same handling
      regardless of the rubber compound. The most popular tread designs are frequently offered in a handful of
      constructions, in multiple rubber compounds, and also in a range of sizes. But before we go too far, a quick word
      about tread design.</p>

    <h1>Tire Size</h1>
    <p>In addition to the aforementioned topics, riders will also have to make some choices regarding tire size.
      Thankfully, this process is fairly straightforward. For most riders in most conditions, tires in the 2.3 - 2.5
      inch range will be the right place to start. Cross country racers, as well as smaller, lighter riders, tend to
      prefer tires in the 2.1 - 2.3 inch range, which typically offer reduced rolling resistance. Riders seeking
      maximum
      traction have learned to trust larger volume Plus tires, although what constitutes "Plus" is growing less clear
      by the day. Whether you consider the current crop of 2.6-2.8 inch tires to be Plus or not, the reality is that
      many of the latest bikes are offering tire clearance up to 2.8 inches, which will tempt plenty of riders to
      experiment with going bigger on their next set of tires. </p>

    <p class="step4-category">Race King</p>
    <p>For a sweet spot between rolling speed, longevity, and traction in variable conditions, this pairing from WTB is
      hard to beat. The Vigilante's open tread pattern offers serious grip when it's loose and dusty, while the Trail
      Boss' tightly spaced knobs maintain a high degree of rolling speed. The 2.3 inch size works best on rims up to
      30mm wide, although we've found this combo to be extremely effective on rims as narrow as 25mm. Note that both
      tires are available in heavier duty casing, also known as the "Tough" version, which riders who suffer frequent
      flats would do well to consider. The stickier HG rubber compound is worth considering for those demanding more
      traction.</p>
